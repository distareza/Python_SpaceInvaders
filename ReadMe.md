Using Python Turtle, build the classic shoot 'em up game - space invaders game.

Space Invaders Wikipedia Page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders  

Your space ship can move left and right and it can hit some alien ships. Every second the aliens will move closer to your ship. Once the aliens touch your ship then it's game over. There are usually some barriers between you and the aliens which offers you defensive positions.
